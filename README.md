ðŸŒ± **Plant Health Monitoring  System **ðŸŒ¿
# Overview
This **Plant Health Monitoring System** is an embedded solution designed to monitor key environmental factors affecting plant growth and automate irrigation when needed. It uses soil moisture, temperature, and humidity sensors to collect real-time data and trigger a motor pump via a relay module when the soil moisture drops below a predefined threshold. The system also features an LCD display with an I2C module for easy data visualization.

# Features
